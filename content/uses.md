## Tools I Use

(Inspired by [awesome-uses](https://github.com/wesbos/awesome-uses))

### Development Environment

* Visual Studio Code (or Intellij, or Vim. But mostly VSCode)
  * A side note about Vim - I'm comfortable with it, but (no longer)
    evangelical about it. It's an editor, it's fast, and I now know it
    well enough that it stays out of my way. I'm sure if I bothered to
    configure nano, I'd feel the same about that.
* Konsole
* Zsh (+ [antibody](http://getantibody.github.io/) to manage plugins)
* I currently use [PopOS](https://system76.com/pop) with the default
  (Gnome-derived) theme. In the past, I've used Fedora with i3wm and
  Fedora with KDE. I think PopOS is doing some pretty cool things in
  the Rust space, which is a good enough reason for me to use it for now.
* [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) for handling json
* [ag](https://geoff.greer.fm/ag/) as a grep replacement. I briefly tried
  [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep), but for my use case
  (which is typically `grep -F`) the speed difference isn't significant
  enough for me to switch
* Terraform + ansible for managing infrastructure
  * I even use an ansible play to manage my dotfiles, for what
    it's worth
* [bazel](https://bazel.build/) as a build tool
  * Use Maven at work, which is a Java only shop. For me, Bazel lets me
    build a bunch of different languages one way. It also has built-in
    tools to package things as debs or rpms, which is a handy way to deploy
    things.
* The font [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) with
  ligatures enabled, everywhere available

### Hardware

* iPhone XR, regrettably sans case.
  * It's a replacement for an iPhone 5s, which also didn't have a
    case, and bore some impressive cracks after having been dropped
    one too many times.
* Toshiba Satellite. Its one damning flaw is that it has an oldish
  Broadcom wifi card, whose driver is not installed by default on Fedora or
  Ubuntu. Even after downloading and installing the driver over Ethernet I've
  never had a good time getting it to work.

### Web Apps

* Netflix & Spotify
* LastPass. I use the free version, and have yet to have a problem with it.
  Unfortunately, its security record is only so-so, so I might move away from
  this at some point.
* GitHub

### Running

* Garmin Forerunner 645 music.
  * It replaces an incredibly beat-up and very old Forerunner 405, which I used until I broke the wristband beyond even the powers
  of copious amounts of superglue
* Saucony Freedom ISO. I've gone through 4+ pairs of these, after switching
  away from Hoka Odysseys (which I found I was wearing through too quickly).
* [Strava](https://strava.com). Strava has, in my opinion, better analytics
  even at the free level than Garmin does, and it really benefits from the
  community aspect of running.
