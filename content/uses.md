## Tools I Use

(Inspired by [awesome-uses](https://github.com/wesbos/awesome-uses))

### Development Tools

* Visual Studio Code (or Intellij, or Vim. But mostly VSCode)
  * A side note about Vim - I'm comfortable with it, but (no longer)
    evangelical about it. It's an editor, it's fast, and I now know it
    well enough that it stays out of my way. I'm sure if I bothered to
    configure nano, I'd feel the same about that.
* Konsole
* Zsh (+ [antibody](http://getantibody.github.io/) to manage plugins)
* I dual-boot Windows and Fedora. I have some non-development Windows-only
  software (namely, Garmin Express) that prevents me from swapping entirely
  to a Linux distro.
  * Currently using [i3](https://i3wm.org/) as the window manager for Fedora,
  without a full desktop environment. Before that I was using the KDE spin.
* [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) for handling json
* [ag](https://geoff.greer.fm/ag/) as a grep replacement. I briefly tried
  [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep), but for my use case
  (which is typically `grep -F`) the speed difference isn't significant
  enough for me to switch
* Terraform + ansible for provisioning
* [bazel](https://bazel.build/) as a build tool
  * Use Maven at work, which is a Java only shop. For me, Bazel lets me
    build a bunch of different languages one way. It also has built-in
    tools to package things as debs or rpms, which is a handy way to deploy
    things.

### Hardware

* iPhone 5s, regrettably sans case. I dropped it several years ago and
  the screen is rather cracked. But it still works, so I've yet to replace it.
* Toshiba Satellite. Its one damning flaw is that it has an oldish
  Broadcom wifi card, whose driver is not installed by default on Fedora or
  Ubuntu. Even after downloading and installing the driver over Ethernet I've
  never had a good time getting it to work.

### Web Apps

* Netflix & Spotify
* LastPass. I use the free version, and have yet to have a problem with it.
  Unfortunately, its security record is only so-so, so I might move away from
  this at some point.
* GitHub

### Running

* Garmin Forerunner 405. I've had it for ~6 years, and it's starting to
  get pretty beat up. Still works great, though!
* Saucony Freedom ISO. I've gone through 4 (?) pairs of these, after switching
  away from Hoka Odysseys (which I found I was wearing through too quickly).
* [Strava](https://strava.com). Strava has, in my opinion, better analytics
  even at the free level than Garmin does, and it really benefits from the
  community aspect of running.
