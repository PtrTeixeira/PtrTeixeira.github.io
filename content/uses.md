## Tools I Use

(Inspired by [awesome-uses](https://github.com/wesbos/awesome-uses))

### Development Tools

* Visual Studio Code (or Jetbrains IDEA, or Vim. But mostly VSCode)
* Konsole
* Zsh (+ antibody to manage plugins)

### Running

* Garmin Forerunner 405. I've had it for ~6 years, and it's starting to
  get pretty beat up. Still works great, though!
* Saucony Freedom ISO. I've gone through 4 (?) pairs of these, after switching
  away from Hoka Odysseys (which I found I was wearing through too quickly).
* [Strava](https://strava.com). Strava has, in my opinion, better analytics
  even at the free level than Garmin does, and it really benefits from the
  community aspect of running.
