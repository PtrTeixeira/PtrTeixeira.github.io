## Review

I live literally around the block from the Symphony Pavement
location and am not a big fan of cooking weekend mornings, so
I've been to Pavement an unfortunate number of times. It really
does have a lot to recommend it - the coffee (and other drinks,
like the matcha latte) are good, if expensive. The bagels are
also good (if also very expensive). Pastries there are fine;
they aren't mind-blowing, and the prices aren't labelled, so buyer beware.

The egg sandwich (the Basic, egg and cheese on a bagel for $5) is not one of the things to recommend it. The eggs are
microwaved at best, and always seem vaguely rubbery to me. You
can avoid it by getting something like the Awakening ($7), which has
enough other things on it that you can't taste the eggs, or the
Vegan Tequila (also $7) which omits the egg altogether, but if you're
trying to get an egg sandwich you have better options.

Result: 6/10
