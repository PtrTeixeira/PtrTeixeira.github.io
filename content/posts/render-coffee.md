## Review

Render Coffee's orders work a little differently than at other
places I've reviewed in the past, so this review might be graded
a little unfairly relative to others. You can't really just order
an egg sammy - for one thing, the eggs are baked rather than fried
or scrambled and for another you get a vegetable (or a meat, I
guess) on your sandwich for free. Given that I wasn't getting my
regular order anyways, I also got the slightly fancier option and
picked the baked egg with potatoes and rosemary, rather than the
plain baked egg, as well as spinach.

Which is why this post might be a little biased - that's a good
sandwich! It's just a little hard to tell now if it's a good
sandwich because it's got a lot of good stuff in it, or if it's a
good sandwich because it's a good sandwich because that's what it
is. On the plus side, though, that question is basically
theoretical. You can't get a cheaper version of the sandwich, so
you just get a good sandwich.

Which does bring up one of my two complaints about Render. An egg
sandwich and a latte comes to ~$12. That's rather more than
getting a latte and a cheap egg sammy at Farmer's Horse or Pavement
(though about the same as getting a sandwich worth having at
Pavement). Render really isn't the place to go for cheap breakfast
food.

My second complaint is that, in my experience, coffee from Render
is somewhat weak. It could be that's a personal preference, or that
I know nothing about coffee, or that a decent amount of ice has
melted when I get to drinking the coffee. The coffee isn't bad, but
you are forewarned if strong coffee is what you're looking for.
