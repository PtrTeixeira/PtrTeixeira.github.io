Taste in music is pretty individual, and I'm not going 
to pretend that I have good taste in music. Indeed, my 
taste in music is pretty bad; I'm about as unmusical as 
you can get.

So this is in no way a list of the "best" albums of the 
2010's. There's a lot of very good albums that I didn't 
listen to, or that I did listen to and wasn't a fan of. 
There's also some albums that were, uh, not critically 
well-received that I rather liked. So I make no claims
whatsoever on this being a "best albums" list. It is,
however, a list of my favorite albums. Thankfully, there's
no way you can argue with that.

You're welcome to think that I'm a moron, though.

In no particular order:

## _22, A Million_ - Bon Iver (2016) ##

I liked it more than _i,i_

## _Melodrama_ - Lorde (2017) ##

Was pretty good.

## _A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships_ - The 1975 (2013) ##

Also pretty good.

## _BEYONCE_ - Beyonce (2014) ##

Is by Beyonce

## _The Bones of What You Believe_ - CHVRCHES (2013) ##

I liked this album

## _Hamilton_ - various artists (2015) ##

A Broadway album? Damn straight

## _Puberty 2_ - Mitsky (2016) ##

Also a thing I like

## _Red_ - Taylor Swift (2012) ##

"All Too Well" is Swift's magnum opus, and more than enough
to earn a spot on this list by itself. It marked the peak of 
Swift's ability to distill a story down into a single, emotive
song - melodramtic, perhaps, but also deeply honest.

_Red_ also marked a transitional point in Swift's career. 
Some of the songs - "All Too Well," "Stay Stay Stay," and 
"Girl At Home," notably - lean deeply into her country origins.
Others - "22" and "I Knew You Were Trouble" - look forward to 
a more electronic, pop-y style that would characterize her later 
music.

Quite beyond the music, it was also a cultural touchstone. 
Who could forget the incessant goat remixes of "Trouble?"
