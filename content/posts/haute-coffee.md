## Review

Now for the coffee show that I work right next to.  Egg sandwiches are
served on brioche and are pretty good. Served hot, with good eggs and
good cheese. There's only one, small problem - the sandwhich is somewhat
small. The brioche, while tasty, is about the size of a dinner role and
there's one egg. You can add vegetables or meat, which is probably the
most reasonable thing to do. Despite that, the sandwich is pretty
reasonably priced at $3.95. Add-ons are between $.50 and $1.

### Addendum

The Cambridge location of Haute Coffee has closed permanently since 
I originally wrote this. They have a second location at 12 Walden St.,
Concord MA.
