## Review

Farmer's Horse has been something of a lifesaver for me
in quarantine. It's about two blocks from where I live
(which is great, given that I am permanently WFH now) and
has been open through quarantine. If that were the end of the
story, I'd be more than happy to support them. Sitting at home
doing work has, quite frankly, been pretty bad for me.

Farmer's Horse also has pretty good egg sandwiches
and good coffee overall. If you're interested they also serve
an iced mocha, which I've heard good things about but found a
little too sweet for me. If I had one complaint about Farmer's
Horse, it's that the bagels aren't that great. I don't know if
they're not chewy enough to start with, or they're panini-pressed
too long, or what else, but the bagel of an egg sammy winds up
being more bread-y than bagel-y. To be clear - I have nothing
against bread, the eggs are great, and neither hell nor high
water has prevented me from going to Farmer's Horse every Friday
morning for an end-of-week pick-me-up. All in all, I have a
firmly entrenched appreciation for the place.

An egg sandwich (egg and cheese on an everything bagel) and a
large iced latte comes to about $8.50.
