## About this Blog

I sincerely intended this to be a tech blog. It turns out, I barely have tech-ish ideas at work,
and having them *outside* of work seems a lot like ... work. So I'm not doing that. Which isn't to
say that I'm definitely not put tech-related ideas on here, but I'm definitely not going to make
myself do that.

If you do want tech-adjacent posts in domains that I'm interested in, why don't you check out
[Jess Frazelle's blog](https://blog.jessfraz.com/) or [Rachel Kroll's](https://rachelbythebay.com/w/)
or [Dan Luu's](https://danluu.com/), or [Cindy Sridharan's](https://medium.com/@copyconstruct)
(on Medium, unfortunately)? Not only are they much smarter than I am and much more
deeply involved in the practice of software engineering, they also have a gift for clearly
communicating deeply technical topics.

As it is, this blog is mostly to periodically remind myself how to write English words and as
a space for me to put down whatever random ideas cross my mind. Think of it as long-form Twitter,
with distinctly fewer trolls (just me!).

## About Me

I currently work as a software engineer at HubSpot, a CRM company (among other things). I
like to say that I work in a DevOps space, but I don't do DevOps - I work on an internal tool
that serves as an extra layer of automation on top of our cluster scheduler,
[Singularity](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity) (and, more recently, Kubernetes). The least
kind way of describing that I do is to say that I transform yaml into other yaml inside of a
web server. It's a dirty job, but somebody's gotta do it.

Work is a Java shop (and Maven *shudder*), but outside of work I've spend some time trying to learn
Go and Rust, along with some more operations-focused tools, like [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/),
Terraform, and [Traefik](https://containo.us/traefik/).

My main hobbies actually outside of work are running and, like many of us social distancing, watching
television. I'm a reasonably competent distance runner and (if I do say so myself) a very competent
television watcher.

If you want to get in touch with me, I created a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PeterTeixeira9) for
that express purpose. Please don't be too mean. I strongly suggest *not* trying to reach out to me on
LinkedIn, I'll probably ignore you. Sorry about that.
