<p>Farmer&rsquo;s Horse has been something of a lifesaver for me
in quarantine. It&rsquo;s about two blocks from where I live
(which is great, given that I am permanently WFH now) and
has been open through quarantine. If that were the end of the
story, I&rsquo;d be more than happy to support them. Sitting at home
doing work has, quite frankly, been pretty bad for me.</p>
<p>Farmer&rsquo;s Horse also has pretty good egg sandwiches
and good coffee overall. If you&rsquo;re interested they also serve
an iced mocha, which I&rsquo;ve heard good things about but found a
little too sweet for me. If I had one complaint about Farmer&rsquo;s
Horse, it&rsquo;s that the bagels aren&rsquo;t that great. I don&rsquo;t know if
they&rsquo;re not chewy enough to start with, or they&rsquo;re panini-pressed
too long, or what else, but the bagel of an egg sammy winds up
being more bread-y than bagel-y. To be clear - I have nothing
against bread, the eggs are great, and neither hell nor high
water has prevented me from going to Farmer&rsquo;s Horse every Friday
morning for an end-of-week pick-me-up. All in all, I have a
firmly entrenched appreciation for the place.</p>
<p>An egg sandwich (egg and cheese on an everything bagel) and a
large iced latte comes to about $8.50.</p>
