      <description>She-Ra and the Princesses of Power isn’t terribly subtle in its moralizing. At one point in S5E12 Princess Entrapta tells Hordak that it&amp;rsquo;s his differences from his hive-mind brothers that make him special. It also doesn’t need to be. She-Ra is grounded on how well the characters are developed and humanized, from the four-legged non-verbal robot Emily to the Best Friends Squad at the center of the show to the villains.</description>

Review Now for the coffee show that I work right next to. Egg sandwiches are served on brioche and are pretty good. Served hot, with good eggs and good cheese. There&amp;rsquo;s only one, small problem - the sandwhich is somewhat small. The brioche, while tasty, is about the size of a dinner role and there&amp;rsquo;s one egg.</description>

Review I live literally around the block from the Symphony Pavement location and am not a big fan of cooking weekend mornings, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been to Pavement an unfortunate number of times. It really does have a lot to recommend it - the coffee (and other drinks, like the matcha latte) are good, if expensive.</description>
