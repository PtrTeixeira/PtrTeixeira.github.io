<h2 id="review">Review</h2>
<p>Render Coffee&rsquo;s orders work a little differently than at other
places I&rsquo;ve reviewed in the past, so this review might be graded
a little unfairly relative to others. You can&rsquo;t really just order
an egg sammy - for one thing, the eggs are baked rather than fried
or scrambled and for another you get a vegetable (or a meat, I
guess) on your sandwich for free. Given that I wasn&rsquo;t getting my
regular order anyways, I also got the slightly fancier option and
picked the baked egg with potatoes and rosemary, rather than the
plain baked egg, as well as spinach.</p>
<p>Which is why this post might be a little biased - that&rsquo;s a good
sandwich! It&rsquo;s just a little hard to tell now if it&rsquo;s a good
sandwich because it&rsquo;s got a lot of good stuff in it, or if it&rsquo;s a
good sandwich because it&rsquo;s a good sandwich because that&rsquo;s what it
is. On the plus side, though, that question is basically
theoretical. You can&rsquo;t get a cheaper version of the sandwich, so
you just get a good sandwich.</p>
<p>Which does bring up one of my two complaints about Render. An egg
sandwich and a latte comes to ~$12. That&rsquo;s rather more than
getting a latte and a cheap egg sammy at Farmer&rsquo;s Horse or Pavement
(though about the same as getting a sandwich worth having at
Pavement). Render really isn&rsquo;t the place to go for cheap breakfast
food.</p>
<p>My second complaint is that, in my experience, coffee from Render
is somewhat weak. It could be that&rsquo;s a personal preference, or that
I know nothing about coffee, or that a decent amount of ice has
melted when I get to drinking the coffee. The coffee isn&rsquo;t bad, but
you are forewarned if strong coffee is what you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
