    <h2 id="about-this-blog">About this Blog</h2>
<p>I sincerely intended this to be a tech blog. It turns out, I barely have tech-ish ideas at work,
and having them <em>outside</em> of work seems a lot like &hellip; work. So I&rsquo;m not doing that. Which isn&rsquo;t to
say that I&rsquo;m definitely not put tech-related ideas on here, but I&rsquo;m definitely not going to make
myself do that.</p>
<p>If you do want tech-adjacent posts in domains that I&rsquo;m interested in, why don&rsquo;t you check out
<a href="https://blog.jessfraz.com/">Jess Frazelle&rsquo;s blog</a> or <a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/">Rachel Kroll&rsquo;s</a>
or <a href="https://danluu.com/">Dan Luu&rsquo;s</a>, or <a href="https://medium.com/@copyconstruct">Cindy Sridharan&rsquo;s</a>
(on Medium, unfortunately)? Not only are they much smarter than I am and much more
deeply involved in the practice of software engineering, they also have a gift for clearly
communicating deeply technical topics.</p>
<p>As it is, this blog is mostly to periodically remind myself how to write English words and as
a space for me to put down whatever random ideas cross my mind. Think of it as long-form Twitter,
with distinctly fewer trolls (just me!).</p>
<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>I currently work as a software engineer at HubSpot, a CRM company (among other things). I
like to say that I work in a DevOps space, but I don&rsquo;t do DevOps - I work on an internal tool
that serves as an extra layer of automation on top of our cluster scheduler,
<a href="https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity">Singularity</a> (and, more recently, Kubernetes). The least
kind way of describing that I do is to say that I transform yaml into other yaml inside of a
web server. It&rsquo;s a dirty job, but somebody&rsquo;s gotta do it.</p>
<p>Work is a Java shop (and Maven <em>shudder</em>), but outside of work I&rsquo;ve spend some time trying to learn
Go and Rust, along with some more operations-focused tools, like <a href="https://www.nomadproject.io/">Nomad</a>,
Terraform, and <a href="https://containo.us/traefik/">Traefik</a>.</p>
<p>My main hobbies actually outside of work are running and, like many of us social distancing, watching
television. I&rsquo;m a reasonably competent distance runner and (if I do say so myself) a very competent
television watcher.</p>
<p>If you want to get in touch with me, I created a <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterTeixeira9">Twitter</a> for
that express purpose. Please don&rsquo;t be too mean. I strongly suggest <em>not</em> trying to reach out to me on
LinkedIn, I&rsquo;ll probably ignore you. Sorry about that.</p>
