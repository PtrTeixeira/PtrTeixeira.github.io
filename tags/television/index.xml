      <title>Avatar: The Legend of Korra (A TV Reflection)</title>

      <description>Avatar: Legend of Korra is best known for not being Avatar: The Last Airbender. It received a certain amount of hate when it came out, and has long been viewed as greatly overshadowed by its predecessor. That view is both accurate and somewhat unfair. Legend of Korra is a very different show than The Last Airbender, with different conflicts and a dramatically different view of trauma, especially emotional trauma, than its predecessor.</description>

      <description>Luz’s relationship with her mother isn’t explored very much in the show, even though it’s such a central part of her motivations. The season ends with her voice memo to Camilla, and specifically with Luz telling her mother that she loves her. But Luz’s love for her mother is also deeply shadowed by her that she will disappoint her mother, or that she already has. “Enchanting Grom Fright” very clearly shows how Luz reacts to her mother’s consternation that she’s not at camp, that she’s holding a weapon.</description>

      <title>She-Ra and the Princesses of Power (A TV Reflection)</title>

      <description>She-Ra and the Princesses of Power isn’t terribly subtle in its moralizing. At one point in S5E12 Princess Entrapta tells Hordak that it&amp;rsquo;s his differences from his hive-mind brothers that make him special. It also doesn’t need to be. She-Ra is grounded on how well the characters are developed and humanized, from the four-legged non-verbal robot Emily to the Best Friends Squad at the center of the show to the villains.</description>
