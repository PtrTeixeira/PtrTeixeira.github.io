Review Render Coffee&amp;rsquo;s orders work a little differently than at other places I&amp;rsquo;ve reviewed in the past, so this review might be graded a little unfairly relative to others. You can&amp;rsquo;t really just order an egg sammy - for one thing, the eggs are baked rather than fried or scrambled and for another you get a vegetable (or a meat, I guess) on your sandwich for free.</description>

Review Now for the coffee show that I work right next to. Egg sandwiches are served on brioche and are pretty good. Served hot, with good eggs and good cheese. There&amp;rsquo;s only one, small problem - the sandwhich is somewhat small. The brioche, while tasty, is about the size of a dinner role and there&amp;rsquo;s one egg.</description>

Review I live literally around the block from the Symphony Pavement location and am not a big fan of cooking weekend mornings, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been to Pavement an unfortunate number of times. It really does have a lot to recommend it - the coffee (and other drinks, like the matcha latte) are good, if expensive.</description>
